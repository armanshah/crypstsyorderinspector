Cryptsy Order Inspector - Desktop notifications for Cryptsy

A small app which keeps track of your orders and notifies you about new or missing (fulfilled/canceled) orders. 

Written in node-webkit, so it should be cross platform. Unfortunately, I only have a Win32 machine to test it, so if you have any problems running it on another platform, don't hesitate to file a bug.

TODO: Building/run instructions

This software uses jQuery, jQuery UI, Aristo theme for jQuery UI, Alertify.js and EJS.
