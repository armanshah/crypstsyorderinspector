### Cryptsy Order Inspector - Desktop notifications for Cryptsy ###
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A small app which keeps track of your orders and notifies you about new or missing (fulfilled/canceled) orders. 

Written in [node-webkit] [7], so it should be cross platform. Unfortunately, I only have a Win32 machine to test it, so if you have any problems running it on another platform, don't hesitate to file a bug. Somebody else might be able to help you.

    TODO: Building/run instructions

This software uses [jQuery] [1], [jQuery UI] [2], [Aristo theme for jQuery UI] [3], [Alertify.js] [4] and [EJS] [5]. Desktop notifications inspired by [nw-desktop-notifications] [6]
